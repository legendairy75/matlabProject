*make ultrasonic sensor output distance in command window
/make ultrasonic sensor tell the arduino to activate the photo resistor circut
*make ultrasonic sensor constantly check the distance of an object
/make photo resistor constantly check if object has crossed it once the photo resistor circut has been activated
make ultrasonic sensor tell the arduino to deactivate the photo resistor circut if the object has gotton further away
